# ENGR296_PROJECT_DESIGN

Final design project to analyze Steam reviews (data obtained from https://github.com/mulhod/steam_reviews). Utilized Python and several libraries to analyze the sentiment of user reviews and attempt to summarize text. We implemented a preprocessing technique that filtered out user reviews and processed them for use in 4 different supervised algorithms. This method resulted in some gained information from analyzing user reviews that tell what user's major opinions about the game are at a certain time period (being able to relate it to patches at the end of report).

The final two files are `analysis.ipynb` which contains the analysis codes along with `utils.py` which have helper functions mostly for preprocessing and postprocessing.
